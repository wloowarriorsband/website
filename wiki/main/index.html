                <p>
                    The Waterloo Warriors band is one of the many bands on the University of Waterloo's campus. Known
                    locally as Warriors Band, they are known for being a part of sporting events. As the official school
                    pep band, they rile up the crowd and encourage the audience to cheer for Waterloo.
                </p>

                The band plays mainly for the sports teams of both women and men around Waterloo, not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Baseball</li>
                    <li>Hockey</li>
                    <li>Football</li>
                    <li>
                        Basketball
                        <a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/stories/index.html#wbs"
                            >(Men's Only as of 2023)</a
                        >
                    </li>
                    <li>Intramural games</li>
                </ul>

                The band also runs or attends events in our community such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Parades of all types in Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge</li>
                    <li>Playing music in the park during holidays</li>
                    <li>Bringing music to the campus with various themes and playing at different locations</li>
                    <li>Robotics Waterloo Regional Championship</li>
                    <li><a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/stories/index.html#do">Drumline Ontario</a></li>
                    <li>The World Partnership Walk</li>
                    <li>Cambridge Arts Festival</li>
                    <li>Playing at UW Concert Band Club's End-of-Term Concert</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                As of <a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/main/index.html#year">1249</a>, the Warriors Band
                Drumline is an active subset of the band and can be found at all the same events as well as their own
                around campus. <br /><br />

                <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                The band was started by
                <a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/govern/index.html#dg">David "Dave" Greenberg</a> and
                four other members in 1966 because they wanted to play some music at sports games. There were four
                founding members: two trumpet players and two clarinet players. Since then, as the school's official pep
                band, Warriors Band has played for many of the university's sports teams as well as events in the
                community, such as parades. The band has also acquired more variety in the instruments! <br /><br />

                Historically, the band demanded members pay back the cost of tickets if they didn't attend the requisite
                number of games. (see
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160429042957/http://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/history/excerpts/"
                    >September 1969</a
                >) <br /><br />

                Later on, the folktale that the band was founded just to get into games for free emerged. This folktale
                was accepted as fact for a good while until David Greenburg contested this claim.
                <br /><br />

                The Drumline subset was founded in
                <a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/main/index.html#year">116X</a> and even went on to win
                an award at Drumline Ontario under Nick Boyko. After an 8 year hiatus, the drumline was brought back in
                <a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/main/index.html#year">1249</a>.

                <h1 id="gen">General Information</h1>

                <h2 id="year">Year Numbering System</h2>
                <p>
                    The Warriors Band date format, voted on in the exec meeting of 1171-68, is the University of
                    Waterloo term code, followed by a hyphen, followed by the number of days since the start of classes
                    for that term (inclusive). This system is not compatible with
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>. For example, the Warriors Band date
                    for May 7th, 2017 is 1175-7. Thomas Broadley built a date converter to convert between the Warriors
                    Band date format, and a year-month-day format but it is no longer available.
                </p>
                <h3>Calculating the Term Code:</h3>
                <p>
                    The first digit of the term code is the century number, starting with the 20th century (19xx) as 0.
                    The current century (21st; 20xx) is 1.
                    <br />
                    The second and third digits of the term code are the last two digits of the year. For example, if
                    the year were 2017, the second and third digits of the term code would be 17.
                    <br />
                    The last digit of the term code is the number of the month in which the term started:<br /><br />

                    To account for the days. 1 represents the first day of the term. So 1179-15 would be the 15th day of
                    Fall 2017. Please refer

                <h3>Translating from the Gregorian Calendar:</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's calculate the Warriors Band date for May 7th, 2017.<br />
                    The year is 2017, and the term is Spring, so the term code is 1175.<br />
                    The first day of classes for this term is May 1st, making May 7th the seventh day since the start of
                    classes.<br />
                    Therefore, the Warriors Band date for May 7th, 2017 is 1175-7.<br />
                </p>

                <h3>Translating to the Gregorian Calender</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's translate 1171-15 to the Gregorian calendar.<br /><br />
                    The first digit of the first part of the date is 1, so the year is in the 21st century (20xx).<br />
                    The second and third digits of the first part of the date are 17, so the year is 2017.<br />
                    The last digit of the first part is 1, which corresponds to the Winter term.<br />

                    The Winter 2017 term started on January 3rd. The second part of the date is 15. The fifteenth day of
                    the Winter 2017 term was January 17th, 2017.<br /><br />

                    For the current day, here is the starter-converted date, give or take for Office of Registrar dates.
                    How to modify to the proper date code is shown below the given term code:
                    <br /><br />
                </p>
                <div id="result"></div>

                <script>
                    let obj = new Date();
                    let day = obj.getDate();
                    let month = obj.getMonth();
                    let year = obj.getFullYear();
                    let total = 0;
                    let newyear = year - 1900;
                    let ndays;
                    let code;

                    if (month < 5) {
                        ndays = year % 4 == 0 ? [31, 29, 30, 31] : [31, 28, 30, 31];
                        code = 1;
                    } else if (month >= 5 && month < 9) {
                        ndays = [31, 30, 31, 31];
                        code = 5;
                    } else {
                        ndays = [30, 31, 30, 31];
                        code = 9;
                    }

                    for (
                        let i = 0;
                        i < (month < 5 ? month : month >= 5 && month < 9 ? month - 5 : month - 9) + 1;
                        i++
                    ) {
                        total += ndays[i];
                    }
                    total += day;

                    // Display the result on the page
                    document.getElementById("result").innerText = `${newyear}${code}-${total}`;
                </script>
                <p>
                    <br />
                    For the number to the right of the '-', please subtract the day classes started. For example, if it
                    is August 27th and classes started May 5th, I would subtract 5 from the number on the right so the
                    code would go from 1245-119 to 1245-114. If you are also between classes at the start of the month,
                    e.g. September 1st, and classes of the fall term start on the 5th, add the numbers of days in the
                    month to the total days of the previous term as well as using the year/month code of the previous
                    term.

                At sports games the band has a set of procedures that are done to hype the team.
                <h3>Basketball Games:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Always stand and play

                    <li>
                        Count the number of times the basketball is bounced when the opposing team takes a foul shot,
                        ending with a shout.
                    </li>

                    <li>Show how many foul shots have been taken on your hand when Waterloo is taking foul shots.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Volleyball Games</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Count the bounces during the opposing team's serve, end with a shout.</li>

                <h3>The Bass Drum Bounty:</h3>
                <br />
                The Bass Drum Bounty states that if a member breaks the bass drum during performance (i.e. uses a mallet
                and smacks the drum so hard it breaks), they win a pizza.<br />
                No one has ever claimed the full bounty. However, years ago, a partial bounty of 1 pizza slice was given
                to Alex McVittie after he accidentally ran into the drum with his baritone saxophone. Legends say this
                incident occurred during the Santa Claus parade, where cold weather impacts the integrity of the bass
                drum material.

                <h2 id="trad">Traditions/Band Culture</h2>

                        When a band member has a birthday, the band will play Happy Birthday while the band member
                        stands in the centre. It really brings the band
                        <em>close together. </em>
                        ;)

                        2:30 is a time of day particularly associated with the Warriors Band. Gaetan Boué originally
                        developed the association, the reasons for which have been lost in the sands of time, but are
                        possibly related to "W" being the 23rd letter of the alphabet. To add, at games when the clock
                        strikes 2:30, band members will shout "U-W, U-W, U-W" while making a U with their arms and
                        swooping them out to make a W shape.

                <h3>$10:</h3>
                "The band will only cost you $10!" This is not true due to instrument rentals and a slight increase in
                membership costs. Back in the day this was the case (excluding instrument rentals).<br />

                <h3>The Website:</h3>
                "Is the website up yet?", "Does the website work yet?", "We have a website?" and similar phrases are
                common inside jokes in the band. Although the website has been fairly stable since the move to the CSC
                servers, the unreliability of the previous version of the website had a lasting impact on its older
                members.
                <br /><br />
                Although downtime is rare nowadays, the availability of the current website is dependent on the
                availability of the CSC servers. In one memorable case in 1159, there was a problem on the servers that
                would cause the website to go down every night after 20:00 for a few weeks. The issue was eventually
                resolved, but it lives on in the jokes.
                <br /><br />
                The
                <a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/cons/index.html#web">website</a>
                before
                <a href="https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/govern/index.html#edfp">Eva Pearson</a>
                was also very outdated/unusable, so band members were never informed of its existence.

                <h3>Emails:</h3>
                Every term there seems to be at least one member that does not read emails or forgets to read an email
                once. This person then becomes known as the person who never reads the emails and jokes ensue that they
                are constantly missing out on important information.<br /><br />

                <h3>Sports:</h3>
                A favourite cheer in the Warriors Band is as follows:<br />
                Leader: "SPORTS!"; Band: "SPORTS!"; Leader: "SPORTS!"; Band: "SPORTS!"; Leader: "SPORTS!"; Band:
                "SPORTS!"; All: "AHHHHH!"
                <br />
                The popularity of this cheer is such that any mention of the word "sports" will result in a spontaneous
                performance of this cheer.<br /><br />
