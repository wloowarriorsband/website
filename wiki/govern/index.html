                                would traditionally be a summer CCWB filling in for when the regular CCWB was away for
                                the spring term (for co-op, for example).
                                As the band is generally easier to run in the spring term compared to any other term, it
                                was used as a training term, and the summer CCWB would potentially become a regular CCWB
                                the following year.
