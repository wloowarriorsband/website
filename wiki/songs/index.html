                <h1>Songs</h1>
                This webpage will go over some context for our most played songs. The actual music pdfs can be found
                through our <a href>Discord </a>.

                <h2 id="form">Format</h2>
                To start things off the format of our music books is very delibrate. All game pieces are on the odd
                numbers and all show pieces are even numbers. The lower the number on the game
                pieces the more often we play it. With the way the book is formatted the opposite is true for show
                pieces. This allows the band to change to the proper music quickly to keep the
                music going.

                <h2 id='bwg'>The Black White and Gold Song</h2>
                The Black and White and Gold is the official school song of the University of Waterloo. It is on page 1
                of the songbook.
                <br><br>
                <h3>When it is played:</h3>
                As the official school song, "The Black and White and Gold" is the most frequently played song by the
                Band. The <a href='https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/cons/index.html#cons'>Constitution</a>
                specifies that the song should be played before
                and after every event at which the Band attends.
                <br><br>
                During practice, it is played at normal speed at the start of practice, and it is tradition to play the
                School Song as fast as possible to close practice (the tempo marking
                is 140 to infinity). On the final practice of a term, it is also <a
                    href='https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/main/index.html#trad'>tradition</a> to have any
                graduating members stand in the middle and sing the song while the rest of the Band plays at
                the end of practice; in this case, the song is played at normal speed.
                <br><br>

                <h2 id='ww'>Waterloo Waterloo</h2>
                Waterloo Waterloo is the unofficial school song. It is one of the two songs on page 3.
                <br><br>
                This song was origianlly created by the cheerleaders and it was so corny it got scrapped, but the band
                was not going to let the cheerleaders forget what they had made.
                <br><br>
                <h3>When it is played:</h3>
                This song is usually played at the start of band practice after <a href='#bwg'>The Black White and Gold
                    Song</a>. At sporting events it is usually played at the first pause the band is allowed
                to play in.
                <br><br>
                During practice the band plays the song a total of 2 times to go through all the lyrics. At games the
                song is ran through once.
                <h3>Lyrics:</h3>

            <h2 id='usaf'>United States Air Force</h2>
            Abreviated to USAF, this is the official song of the U.S. Air Force. It is the song on page 5.
            <br><br>
            <h3>When is it played:</h3>
            By <a href='https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/cons/index.html#cons'>Constitution</a> the band must play
            this song on loop after the start of play at every basketball game until the first basket by the home team
            is made. If an injury happens
            the band will stop playing the instruments and hum or "dum" the song instead to resume playing instruments
            when everything is in the clear.
            <br><br>

            <h2 id='dwbh'>Don't Worry Be Happy</h2>
            This is the Bands losing song. It is found on page 7 and was originally sung by Bob Marley.
            <br><br>
            you will notice that this song comes before the victory song. That is because this one is played more often.
            <br><br>
            There are also optional lyrics that one can shout instead of playing in the last row of the music.
            <h3>When it is played:</h3>
            After the team loses a game the band will play <a href='#bwg'>The Black White and Gold Song</a> to end the
            game and then will go into this song as the crowd leaves.
            <br><br>

            <h2 id='ndvm'>Notre Dame Victory March</h2>
            This is the Bands Victory Song. It is found on page 9
            <h3>When is it played:</h3>
            After the team wins a game the band will play <a href='#bwg'>The Black White and Gold Song</a> to end the
            game and then will go into this song as the crowd leaves.
            <br><br>

            <h2 id='otrr'>Old Time Rock and Roll</h2>
            Also known as Old Time, this is a show piece on page 40.
            <h3>When is it played:</h3>
            This song is a showpiece so it will be played at events like concert band intermission or at halftime during
            games.
            <h3>Competition:</h3>
            The difference between Old Time and other show peices is that Old Time contains a mini in band competetion.
            There is a repeated section at the end. When the band first starts
            playing the repeated part the band will increase their volume by a significant amount. Once it's time to
            repeat that is where the competetion begins.<br>
            The rules are:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Play as loud as you can. </li>
                <li>Had to play the whole song </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            During practice the winner gets a <a
                href='https://warriorsband.uwaterloo.ca/wiki/main/index.html#Warriors'>Warriors Band</a> rain
            poncho.<br>
            At concert band the audience gets to vote for which section is the loudest. Winners get bragging rights in
            this
            case.
